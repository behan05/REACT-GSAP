# ðŸš€ React Roadmap from Scratch (with GSAP & Redux)

This roadmap will guide you step by step from learning **React basics** to **building real projects**, while also using **GSAP for animations** and **Redux for state management**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Phase 1: React Basics + GSAP Basics

ðŸ•’ **Duration:** 1-2 weeks

### âœ… Step 1: Setup React & JSX

- Install React using Vite
- Understand JSX syntax and its differences from HTML

### âœ… Step 2: Components & Props

- Functional components
- Props (Passing data between components)

### âœ… Step 3: State & Events

- useState Hook (Managing component data)
- Handling events (onClick, onChange)
- Lifting state up between components

### âœ… Step 4: GSAP Basics in React

- Installing GSAP in React
- Using `useRef` and `useEffect` for animations
- Basic animations (fade-in, scaling, etc.)

---

## ðŸ“Œ Phase 2: React Router + Advanced GSAP

ðŸ•’ **Duration:** 1-2 weeks

### âœ… Step 5: React Router (Navigation)

- Installing React Router
- Setting up Routes and Links
- Creating multiple pages (Home, About, Contact)

### âœ… Step 6: GSAP ScrollTrigger (Scroll Animations)

- Registering ScrollTrigger
- Animating elements on scroll
- Creating smooth scroll effects

### âœ… Step 7: GSAP Timelines & Stagger Effects

- Creating GSAP Timelines (`gsap.timeline()`)
- Using `staggerTo` & `staggerFrom` for animations

---

## ðŸ“Œ Phase 3: State Management (Redux & Context API)

ðŸ•’ **Duration:** 1-2 weeks

### âœ… Step 8: React Context API

- Creating a global state with Context
- Using `useContext` for state sharing

### âœ… Step 9: Redux for State Management

- Understanding Redux store, actions, reducers
- Setting up Redux Toolkit
- Using `useSelector` & `useDispatch`
- Handling async state with Redux Thunk

---

## ðŸ“Œ Phase 4: React Hooks + GSAP ScrollSmoother

ðŸ•’ **Duration:** 1-2 weeks

### âœ… Step 10: Advanced React Hooks

- `useEffect` for side effects
- `useRef` for DOM manipulation
- `useMemo` & `useCallback` for performance optimization

### âœ… Step 11: GSAP ScrollSmoother (Smooth Page Scroll)

- Installing ScrollSmoother
- Creating smooth scrolling effects

---

## ðŸ“Œ Phase 5: Forms, API, Backend & Deployment

ðŸ•’ **Duration:** 1-2 weeks

### âœ… Step 12: Forms & API Handling

- Controlled & uncontrolled components
- Fetching data using `fetch` & `axios`
- Handling API requests in Redux (Redux Thunk)

### âœ… Step 13: Backend (Optional) & Deployment

- (Optional) Connecting React to a Node.js backend
- Deploying React app on **Vercel / Netlify**
- Deploying backend on **Render / Railway**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Project: Animated Portfolio ðŸš€

**Once all topics are covered, build your own React + GSAP portfolio with:**  
âœ… Multiple pages using **React Router**  
âœ… Animations using **GSAP & ScrollTrigger**  
âœ… Forms with **Redux for state management**  
âœ… Fully responsive and **deployed online**

---

# âœ… Conclusion

By following this roadmap, you will master **React, GSAP, and Redux** and build interactive projects. ðŸš€ðŸ”¥

**Happy Coding! ðŸ’™**
